## Feature

## Description
**As a** a member of [the development team](http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-dev),
**I want** clear context and goals **so that** I can work efficiently.

Scattering information in emails and other places makes it difficult to work collaboratively,
so I need all the relevant information within the relevant issue.


### Acceptance Criteria

1. I have clear Acceptance criteria [what a beautiful recursion].
1. I have to understand the logic of the mockups, more than the pixels used, so that we can optimize the code.

Please also note:

1. If a conversation about the issue I’m working on is happening,
the outcomes should be documented within that issue (not in the comments).
